            <h1>Working and Learning from Home During the COVID-19 Outbreak</h1>
            <h6> By: Corinn Cross, MD, FAAP</h6>

                    <div class="image main">
                        <img src="/images/blog-fullscreen-1-1920x700.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""/>
                    </div>

                    <p>To help contain COVID-19, many schools moved children to online learning at home. In addition,
                        many parents are being asked to work from home. These forms of social distancing help slow the
                        spread of the virus and prevent overloading the health care system.

                        But many families now face new challenges: how do we care for our children while working and
                        schooling at home, and not panic during this unprecedented outbreak? The first step: take a deep
                        breath. Know that we are all in this together. And together we will get through it.

                        Here are some other tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics to help you cope with this “new
                        normal"
                        until the virus is under control.</p>

                    <p>It may be tempting to get kids together for play dates or sleepovers, but this should be avoided.
                        Social distancing only works if we all participate. And slowing down or preventing the spread of
                        the virus will save lives.

                        Protect grandparents. This is also not the time to visit grandparents or ask them to help out
                        with child care duties. People who are over age 60 are at higher risk of severe illness with
                        COVID-19 and should not increase that risk by being around children who may be ill with mild
                        symptoms.
                        However, they may feel alone or disconnected during social distancing,
                        so keep up communications through phone calls, texting, or video chats.</p>

                    <p>Since changes in routine can be stressful, it will be helpful to
                        talk with your kids about why they are staying home and what your daily structure will be
                        during this time. Let them help create a daily schedule that can hang on the refrigerator or
                        somewhere they can see it each day. Be sure to include breaks from tele-work or schoolwork to
                        relax and connect with each other.

                        Here are some ideas to help you create a daily schedule:

                        Wake up, get dressed and have breakfast at the normal time.

                        Decide where everyone can do their work most effectively and without distractions.

                        List the times for learning, exercise and breaks.</p>
